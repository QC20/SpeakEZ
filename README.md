## Dialog Management
At the core of modern conversational agents lies the "dialog manager," which determines suitable outputs based on user inputs. Inputs are categorized into _audio_ and _transcript_, with most implementations converting audio to text for efficiency. Dialog managers typically produce text outputs, facilitating flexibility for different text-to-speech implementations.
